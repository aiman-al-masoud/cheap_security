# cheap_security

In this repo I'll try to upload assorted security-solutions, mostly in java, that aren't meant to be taken seriously. 
I mean, they're ok-ish for small projects, or for the sake of 'demonstration', I guess. But don't come back here
complaining that they fail to protect you data! 

Use them at your own risk, and have fun!
